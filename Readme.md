Arduino library for the Analog devices AD5934 12 bit impedance converter.

This library is work in progress and it should be noted that I am not a software developer but rather someone who was in need of a library and had to write one on his own. To do this I received some help from another project and I also used some of their code: https://github.com/WuMRC/drive

In principle, the library for the AD5933 can also be used, but the user needs to provide an external clock to the part for it to work.

As mentioned above, this is work in progress and is currently not fully featured (but functional).

Documentation for the part can be found at http://www.analog.com/en/products/rf-microwave/direct-digital-synthesis-modulators/ad5934.html

Documentation for the library and one or two examples will be added here in due time.
